# img2pattern
Takes an image and helps break it down so that it can be crocheted in a "paint by numbers" fashion

## How to run
- Install Python 2.x
- drag/drop image on top of the img2pattern.py file (alternatively, pass the full path of the image in as a command line parameter)
- open up the new html file

#How to Contribute
- Fork off of dev
- Be sure to keep up to date and rebase your branches off of dev
- Pull Requests will only be accepted if they are one commit and are tested
- I am not hard to work with and will probably just accept pull requests without issue
